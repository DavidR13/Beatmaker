# Beatmaker

Beatmaker project created using HTML, CSS, and JS. To practice and continue learning more about JS, this project allows a person to create beats using different kick, snare, and hi-hat sounds. This project was useful in helping me improve in how to use classes, event listeners, and manipulating the DOM.
